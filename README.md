A hands-on lab demonstrating how to use embedding models from both **IBM watsonx.ai** and the **Hugging Face Hub** to convert text documents into meaningful numerical vectors.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Imagine building an intelligent search system for a company with a vast amount of text data. Traditional keyword search often fails because it can't understand the *context* or *semantic meaning* of a query.

This lab tackles that challenge using **document embedding**. We will convert text into rich numerical vectors that capture its underlying meaning, forming the foundation for applications like semantic search, classification, and clustering. We will explore and implement solutions from two leading platforms: the enterprise-grade **IBM watsonx.ai** and the open-source powerhouse **Hugging Face**.

## ðŸ”¬ Core Concepts: What are Embeddings?

An **embedding** is a dense vector of numbers that represents a piece of text in a high-dimensional space. Think of it as assigning a unique coordinate to each document on a giant "map of meaning."

* **How it works:** An embedding model, trained on massive text corpora, learns to place documents with similar meanings close to each other in this vector space.
* **Why it's powerful:** For a search system, we can convert a user's query into a vector and then find the document vectors that are closest to it. This retrieves results based on meaning, not just keyword matches, leading to far more accurate results.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1.  **Prepare and Preprocess Documents:** Implement the necessary steps to clean and prepare raw text data for the embedding process.
2.  **Generate Embeddings:** Use both **IBM watsonx.ai** and **Hugging Face** embedding models to transform your preprocessed documents into numerical vectors.
